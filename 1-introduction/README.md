# Introduction

Or fundumentals of programming is the first course in which you start learning functional programming. 

The codes in this course are written in C++ but you won't get to use objects and classes yes. Apart from the libraries used (iostream mostly) the codes can be C.

## Compiling

### GNU Compiler Collection

To [compile in *nix](https://github.com/mohsend/Magnificent-University-Projects/wiki/Compiling-using-GCC) (Linux, OS X, freeBSD,...) using GCC run this command in terminal:

```bash
$ gcc -Wall code_file.cpp
```

And then you can run the compiled executable by running:

```bash
$ ./a.out
```

### Microsoft Visual Studio .net

Add this line on top of the C++ code if you want to compile in Visual Studio.net:
```c++
#include "stdafx.h"
```
