To compile each program, simply compile it with gcc

for example , 

```
gcc sleep.c -o sleep.o

```

you can use __-o__ argument to determine name of output file

syscall to cover:

[ ] execl

[ ] execv

[x] sleep  in __sleep.c__ 

[x] getpid  in __printf_pid_ppid.c__ 

[x] getppid  in __printf_pid_ppid.c__ 

[ ] wait

[ ] exit

[ ] write 

[x] printf in __printf_pid_ppid.c__
