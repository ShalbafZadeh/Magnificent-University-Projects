# MASM 8086 Assembly
These files are simple tested 8086 assembly codes. 

I wrote a [wiki page on how to assemble these files in Persian](https://github.com/mohsend/Magnificent-University-Projects/wiki/assembly).

The Art of Assembly Language Programming by Randall Hyde is an excellent reference for your assembly needs and beyond.

## DOSBox Emulator
Chances are you don't have a 16-bit MS-DOS PC handy. I used DOSBox the open source MS-DOS emulator for my needs and it worked perfectly.

## MASM
[This page from Carleton University](http://www.scs.carleton.ca/sivarama/asm_book_web/free_MASM.html) provides you a download link for masm and a basic how-to for using it.

## DEBUG
DOSBox doesn't have DEBUG program by default. you can download this excellent open source equivalent from the button of the linked page and place the ```DEBUG.COM``` file in your working directory (the one with MASM in it) and use it. 
The page also has all the commands this program uses. I personally only had to use `T`, `D`, and `Q`.

## SETEDIT
DOSBox doesn't have an editor neither. 
you can use your favorite IDE or editor on the host OS.
but I also found this open source editor (SETEDIT) for DOS. You can get it here: [SETEDIT download](http://setedit.sourceforge.net/#download)
