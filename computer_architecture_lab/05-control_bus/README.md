# Bus selectors using buffers

We used the Enable pin of 74SL244 4-bit buffers to select the output from several inputs.

- [Select between 2 4-bit buses](2bus_4bit.pdsprj)

There's a latch before `input B` to observe their behaviour.

- [Select between 2 8-bit busses](2bus_8bit.pdsprj)
- [Select between 4 4-bit busses](4bus_4bit.pdsprj)
