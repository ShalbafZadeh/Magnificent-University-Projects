# 4-bit Adder made with 4 Full Adder subcircuits

We learn how to make subcircuits and terminals to simplify our circuit design and keep it modular and managable.

We moved the full-adder from the previous experiment to a subcircuit. Then used 4 of the subcircuits in parrallel to make a 4-bit adder.
