#MASM 8086 Assembly
These files are simple tested 8086 assembly programs. 

I wrote a [wiki page on how to assemble these files in Persian](https://github.com/mohsend/Magnificent-University-Projects/wiki/assembly).

##8086 instruction set
Fantastic [Complete 8086 instruction set](http://www.electronics.dit.ie/staff/tscarff/8086_instruction_set/8086_instruction_set.html) from Dublin institute of technology.

##DOSBox Emulator
Chances are you don't have a 16-bit MS-DOS PC handy. I used DOSBox the open source MS-DOS emulator for my needs and it worked perfectly.

##MASM
[This page from Carleton University](http://www.scs.carleton.ca/sivarama/asm_book_web/free_MASM.html) provides you a download link for masm and a basic how-to for using it.

##DEBUG
DOSBox doesn't have DEBUG program by default. you can download this excellent open source equivalent from the button of the linked page and place the DEBUG.COM or DEBUG.EXE file in your working directory (the one with MASM in it) and use it. 
The page also has all the command this program uses. I personally only had to use "T", "D", and "Q".
