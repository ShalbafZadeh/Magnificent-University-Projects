# Mano's Basic Computer
Here you'll find Assembly code for [Mano's Basic Computer](http://sandsduchon.org/duchon/cs311/ManoTutorial/ManoIntroduction.html). There's also assembled machine code (memory dump) for tracing and simulating, and the equivalent C code for easier understanding.

The memory dump is generated by [this awesome computer simulator by Dr. Nicholas Duchon](http://sandsduchon.org/duchon/cs311/CompSim/index.html). 

He also has (some example assembly programs)[http://sandsduchon.org/duchon/cs311/ManoTutorial/ManoExamples.html] in his site.
