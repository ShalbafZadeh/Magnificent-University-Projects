# Magnificent University Projects

## What is this?

I study CS in IAUCTB and here I share every practice and example code (mostly C/C++) I wrote. These codes are not practical and have educational purposes only.

For more information refer to each course's own readme.

## Contributing

You can help by sending a pull-request for new code or improving the existing ones. Keep in mind these are for educational purposes so please keep them simple and comment a lot! Contributing to the [Wiki](https://github.com/mohsend/Magnificent-University-Projects/wiki) is also appreciated.
